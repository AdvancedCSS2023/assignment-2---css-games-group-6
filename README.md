# Assignment 2 - Tiny CSS game

## What the project does?
### Maze game
The project consists of a maze game where a character controlled by a mouse cursor must try to find their way through the maze and to the goal in the center.
If the player touches any of the walls or gets run over by an enemy ghost, then the player is forced to start over. Reaching the center, and you win the game.

## Why the project is useful?
The project is useful to us students as we learn creative ways of using CSS. We learn more about how to structure components in more effective manners, and about files architecture.
The game is useful for users too because it can help improve their concentration, problem solving skills, and reaction time. Additionally, it can be a fun and entertaining way to spend leisure time.
